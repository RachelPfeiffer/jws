I'm using Copilot to recreate this site using laravel api and react frontend.
the goal final site should have 
1. the basic landing page and contact form
2. a back end where you can add courses and manage students and cohorts,including billing and payment
3. a student portal where students can login and see their progress and pay for courses
4. a chat system to help schedule the classes where the chat is open for a while and the the moderator can close it and schedule the class
